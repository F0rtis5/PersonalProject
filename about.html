	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Congrats! You made it to page 2! My name is Chase Earnest. For the last 10 years I have worked a multitude of manual labor positions
		   I recently felt like I had more to accomplish so I enrolled at Indian Hills Community College as a computer software development student.
		   I know that if I finish this degree, the sky is the limit and there are plenty of avenues that I can take as I advance my career. I started
		   learning python a few years ago as I wanted to learn how to make discord bots and realized that I really enjoy writing code. Ideally, completing
		   this program will allow me to stop working in the field, and start working a job that I enjoy doing.</p>

		<h2>Personal</h2>
		<p>In my personal life, I am a hobby musician. I play guitar and sing and have been doing so for close to 15 years. Music is something that I am
		   passionate about, but it's just a hobby for me. I also enjoy spending time with my pets. I have 3 cats (Ziggy, Figgy, and Smudge) and a pomeranian
		   named Cubby.</p>
